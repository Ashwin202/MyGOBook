    <h1>Structs in Go</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Go, structs are composite data types that allow you to group together different types of data into a single
        unit. They are similar to classes in other object-oriented languages but are more lightweight and flexible.</p>

    <h2>Defining a Struct</h2>

    <p>You define a new struct using the <code>type</code> and <code>struct</code> keywords:</p>

    <pre><code>type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}</code></pre>

    <p>Here, <code>Person</code> is the name of the struct, and it contains two fields: <code>Name</code> of type
        <code>string</code> and <code>Age</code> of type <code>int</code>.</p>

    <h3>Creating Instances of a Struct</h3>

    <p>To create an instance of a struct, you can initialize it with values for its fields:</p>

    <pre><code>func main() {
    // Creating a new Person instance
    var john Person
    john.Name = "John Doe"
    john.Age = 30

    // Accessing and modifying fields
    fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", john.Name, john.Age)

    // Creating another Person instance using a struct literal
    jane := Person{Name: "Jane Smith", Age: 25}
    fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", jane.Name, jane.Age)
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Structs with Pointers</h2>

    <p>Structs can also be used with pointers, which allows you to pass references to the struct instead of copying it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>func modifyPerson(p *Person) {
    p.Age = 40 // Changes the age of the person through the pointer
}

func main() {
    var john Person
    john.Name = "John Doe"
    john.Age = 30

    modifyPerson(&john) // Passes a pointer to the Person instance
    fmt.Printf("%s is now %d years old.\n", john.Name, john.Age)
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>

    <h3>Database Records</h3>

    <p>Structs are commonly used to represent rows from a database:</p>

    <pre><code>type Employee struct {
    ID        int
    Name      string
    Department string
    Salary    float64
}

func main() {
    // Retrieving an employee record from a database
    employee := Employee{
        ID:        1,
        Name:      "Alice",
        Department: "Engineering",
        Salary:    75000,
    }

    // Use the employee data for various operations
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Configuration Settings</h3>

    <p>Structs can also be used to manage configuration settings in applications:</p>

    <pre><code>type Config struct {
    Port     int
    Database string
    Username string
    Password string
}

func loadConfig() Config {
    // Load configuration from file or environment variables
    return Config{
        Port:     8080,
        Database: "mysql",
        Username: "user",
        Password: "password",
    }
}

func main() {
    config := loadConfig()

    // Use configuration settings in the application
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Structs are fundamental to organizing and representing data in Go programs. They provide a flexible way to group
        related data together and are widely used in various domains such as database operations, configuration
        management, and more.</p>
